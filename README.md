# codingame
My solutions to the codingame games I've played.

I play a bit of [codingame](https://www.codingame.com/), and I like to keep a record of the code I write, so here it is!

You will find a link to the game's page in each folder.

The code is often split into multiple files even though that's not possible in the codingame IDE.
That's because I generally code everything locally, then mash everything into a single file and copy it to the website.
But to keep things more readable, I put the code back in multiple files once the project is validated.

Also, keep in mind that the codingame inputs are sanitized, so I generally don't bother doing any error management.
